# Movie-Recommender

The objective of this project is to build a movie recommendation engine based on the content.
We have made use of content-based filtering in python. The scope of this project is to
find out similarities within the content in order to recommend the users a movie they might
like. Based on what the user likes, the algorithm will simply pick items with similar content
to recommend to the user. There will be less diversity in the recommendations, but this will
work whether the user rates things or not. There are many categories using which we can
calculate the similarity between the content. In this case of movies, we can decide to build
our own recommender system based on genre, director, main actors and so on.
The content liked by the user will be the input to the system and a list of recommendations is
expected from this model.
